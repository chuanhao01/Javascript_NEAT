# Javascript_NEAT

Hi again, this was a project I embarked on because I was interested in because I was interested in genetic algorithms.  
More specifically, I was interested in seeing how this specific genetic algorithm, the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies(NEAT) would do.  
I'm not going to lie, I started on this as a joke to see if I could code something as complicated as this. Welp after a few months and many lost hours, a stable version of the library is done.  

### Special mention
For this I would like to give a special mention to my friend [@David-The-Programmer](https://github.com/David-The-Programmer) for helping me in some parts of trying to code this library for NEAT in `Javascript and p5.js` with me.

## Quick Start guide  
Sadly, due to time I probably will not be writing a documentation for this library code, but here is a quick guide on how to use the library.
